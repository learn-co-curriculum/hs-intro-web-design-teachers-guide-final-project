###SWABTS

+ Site Planning - Think through and visualize the structure of their website
+ Wireframing - Create digital or hand drawn mockups of their site

###Motivation/ Why Should You Care?
Do you think Michelangelo just walked into the Sistine Chapel and started slapping paint on the ceiling? No way! Careful planning goes into creating a masterpiece and you should think about final projects that same way.

###Lesson Plan
+ Have students spend 10-15 minutes brainstorming for their projects before they even start coding.
+ Projects will need to be linked to Github - will need a Github repository.
+ Before you start building your site think about your users and your site’s purpose. Who do you want to build for? What do you want to create?
+ All the elements you create should be serving that purpose and also making your as user friendly as possible.
+ You will probably want to have multiple pages. 
+ Think about creating a flowchart to make sure that your site is organized and that it is easy for your user’s to get where they need to go.
+ Gliffy can be a helpful tool here. (see week 5 materials)
+ Planning out how each page of your site will look is also important.
+ Take a look at the site planning resources like Balsamiq, and Gliffy that can help you create mockups.
+ Another important thing to think about is creating a responsive website. You should think about how your pages will look like on both large and small screens and decide if you want to start out designing for desktops or follow a mobile first approach.

+ And now grasshopper you are ready to create. Go get ‘em!


###Conclusion
+ Ideation is the most important part of the final project stage.

###Hints / Hurdles
+ Ideation is often the biggest challenge for students. They're typically not given a lot of time for creative work in school, or really open ended topics. Can be useful to have suggestions. Coax them to what they're personally interested in 
+ Decide if you want your students to work in groups, or alone. Do you chose the groups or let them?
